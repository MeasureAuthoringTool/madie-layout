# This workflow will do the following:
# - perform a clean install of node dependencies
# - lint the source code for errors
# - build the source code
# - run tests and capture code coverage
# - run end-to-end tests
# - upload the code coverage report to Codacy
# - upload the code coverage report to Codecov
